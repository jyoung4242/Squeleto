      # GETTING STARTED WITH HATHORA SERVER 
      
      ## .env file 
      
      - **IMPORTANT** - First and foremost, don't share this file with anyone, that creates security concerns 
      
      - **IMPORTANT** - Don't push this to Git or to your GitHub repo, that exposes it to the world 
      
      - There are three data keys that need to be in the .env file 
      
      ```
        APP_SECRET="this comes from Hathor Console when you create your app"
        DEV_TOKEN="retrieve this from Hathora CLI" 
        APP_ID="this comes from Hathora Console when you create your app" 
      ``` 
      The DEV_TOKEN is found using Hathora CLI... !

      [Hathora Doc on Dev Token](https://hathora.dev/docs/guides/generate-developer-token)

      The APP_SECRET and APP_ID is from Hathora Console where you create your App initially. 
      
      [Hathora Console](https://console.hathora.dev/login) 
      
      - First you register and login to Hathora Console, then click the create application button !
      
      ![Alt text](./image1.png) 
      
      After you create your application, the App ID and APP Secret will be listed at the top.

      - FINALLY, remember to move your .env file to the root folder of your project
